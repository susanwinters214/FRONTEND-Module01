GIT CLONE:
git clone  # puts a copy of the remote repository on our machine

GIT PUSH:
git push  # after we worked on the local version of the repository, we can push those changes to the remote
git push -u origin main  # only for first push
git push  # you can just git push after you setup the -u (upstream flag) on whatever branch you specified (main)

GIT PULL:
git pull  # pulls the latest version of the remote repository to our machine.
        # We use this after we have already cloned a copy of the remote repository to our local machine,
        # because someone else may have updated the remote in the meantime.
        # So we want to make sure we have the most up to date version.

GIT STAGE:
git add .

GIT COMMIT:
git commit â€“m "a descriptive message"

git branch featureBranch
git checkout featureBranch
git add .
git commit -m "adding a change from the feature branch"
git checkout main
git push origin featureBranch
git merge branchName
git checkout main
git pull  # doing this before any merge or push is almost always a good idea
git merge featureBranch

We'll create a new branch called bugFix:

git branch bugFix
Then, we'll switch to the bugFix branch:

git checkout bugFix
Once on bugFix, we'll make changes. Then, we need to add our changes to the staging area and commit them.

git add .
git commit -m "Made some changes on bugFix"
It's time to merge bugFix into our main branch.

git checkout main
git merge bugFix

CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
Resolve Merge Conflicts
Abort - stop the process

git merge --abort
Resolve the conflict manually - go through the code and making edits

git diff --color-words main..branch1 filename.txt
or

git show --color-words
Take out the git markers and choose what changes we want.

git status
git add filename.txt
git status
git commit -m "with a descriptive message"
DONE
